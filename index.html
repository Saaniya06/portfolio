        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I am a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to choose this field of study, and I am dedicated to learning as much as I can about it.
            I am a curious and passionate student eager to learn and explore new things. While I am still in the early stages of my academic journey, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
            As I continue on my educational journey, I am eager to gain more hands-on experience and apply my knowledge to real-world problems. I am looking forward to exploring internship opportunities in the electronics and communication engineering field to further enhance my skills and gain practical experience.</p>
